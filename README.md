# FnEditor
A text editor written in rust, with my Laststraw GUI library.

# Why
I thought it would be best to test my own libary and any new or upcoming features to [Laststraw](https://github.com/had2020/Last-Straw)
I was never able to create the text editor with dixous, so I created it with my own GUI library.
